## Purpose

Adding visual flare to projects quickly and efficiently.

## Installation

Node.js and Inquirer version 8.2.4 are required for the application to run. I've also employed Jest in order to operate the testing suites.

## Usage

The application is initiated by typing "node index.js" within a terminal that's opened in the application folder. The only thing that's needed following that is to answer each of the questions that appear in the terminal. The application accepts both all of the color keyword defaults currently recognized by CSS, as well as any three or six character hexadecimal color code. The hexadecimal code must be preceded by a "#" in order to be recognized by the application.
